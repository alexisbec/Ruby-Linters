# Ruby Capstone

## Description

This is the Capstone Project from the Microverse Ruby course. I had to create my own linter, a tool that helps you to find some syntax errors in your code with the purpose of making it look better.

- Two spaces: It will check if any of your lines have two spaces between each element.
- Spaces before an operator.
- Spaces between two operators.
- Spaces after an operator.
- Semicolons: The semicolons are unnecessary at the end of the line, so it will return an error.
- Spaces at the end of the line.
- Empty lines.

The linter describes all the errors that your program has and the total of the errors.

## Errors

Here are some examples of bad / good code that the linter checks.

**_Two spaces between elements_**

> Bad code:

```
def  sum
  counter += 1
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```

**_Spaces before an operator_**

> Bad code:

```
def sum
  counter+= 1
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```

**_Spaces between two operators_**

> Bad code:

```
def sum
  counter + = 1
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```

**_Spaces after an operator_**

> Bad code:

```
def sum
  counter +=1
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```

**_Semicolons_**

> Bad code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1;
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```

**_Spaces at the end of the line_**
> The | symbol shows where the line ends

> Bad code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1    |
end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1|
end
```

**_Empty lines_**

> Bad code:

```


def sum
  counter += 1


end
```

> Good code:

```
def sum
  counter += 1
end
```
